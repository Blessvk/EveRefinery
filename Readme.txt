Building
--------
* Originally compiled under VS2008 C#
* Requires installed SQLite.Net to build. If it doesn't help, you might want to remove and re-add reference to it in the project.

Going to add your code? Don't :)
--------------------------------
* I don't really need any help on developing this thing.
* The reason why i published it opensource are all those guys (75% paranoids and 25% thinking they are going to improve it) getting me bored asking to do so.
* Keep in mind i will be VERY strict on code quality, strict on code style and strict on keeping tool from getting bloated with unneeded features.

Still going to? Doh.
--------------------
* a_ prefix is function parameter
* m_ prefix is member variable
* If your code looks and feels like mine and does something useful, i will most probably accept it.
* Should i accept your code, i will add you to credits.
